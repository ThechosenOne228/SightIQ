## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sightiq.git
   cd sightiq
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser:
   ```bash
   # Using Python's built-in server
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Or using Node's http-server
   npx http-server
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

## üì± Usage

1. Allow camera access when prompted
2. Point your camera at objects you want to detect
3. View real-time detection results with metadata
4. Use the camera switch button to toggle between front and back cameras
5. Share your detections using the share button

## üîß Configuration

The application can be configured by modifying the following constants in `index.html`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: 0.6,  // Detection confidence threshold
    MAX_DETECTIONS: 20,         // Maximum number of simultaneous detections
    CANVAS_SIZE: { width: 640, height: 480 }  // Detection canvas size
};
```
